			People Can Do Incredible Things When United By Good Ideas.

		.divider

		%p 
			If you don't know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdfunding">Crowdfunding</a>, it is a new model that is redefining the way we bring our ideas to life. <span>Our goal is to make the process just a little easier</span>, so anyone can use crowdfunding to realize their ideas with the help of others. 
		%p 
			With resources to learn about the industry, tools to run your own campaign, and a meeting grounds to get thoughts and feedback, we've put a ton of working into building this toolkit, but <span class="important">we cant do this alone.</span>
		%p 
			If you're thinking about launching a project, know someone who plans to crowdfund, or just want to <span>help good ideas succeed</span>, take a look at the site, share some advice, or pass the link to a friend. 
		%p 
			<span class="important">We're really excited to make this happen, and hope to have you onboard.</span>
